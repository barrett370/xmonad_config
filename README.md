# xmonad_config

Forked from DistroTube's [config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.xmonad), removed redundant functionality as well as other miscellaneous tweaks I can't remember well enough to list

Important Keybindings:

- Meta+Shift+w     => launch brave browser (change `myBrowser`)
- Meta+Enter       => launch st (change `myTerminal`)
- Meta+{1..8}      => swap to workspace _x_
- Meta+Ctrl+Space  => launch dmenu_run (application launcher)
- Meta+Ctrl+Enter  => launch terminal scratchpad
- Meta+Ctrl+m      => launch music scratchpad
- Meta+Shift+Q     => close xmonad
- Meta+Shift+C     => close current window
- Meta+Tab         => cycle workspace views
- Meta+Space       => toggle fullscreen
- Meta+{j,k}       => navigate windows in current workspace
- Meta+{h,l}       => resize current window
- Meta+Shift+{h,l} => move to next/prev workspace
